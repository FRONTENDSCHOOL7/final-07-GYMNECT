If you want to change the remote repository URL for your Git repository, you can do so using the following Git commands. You need to remove the existing remote named "origin" and then add a new remote with the updated URL:

To remove the existing remote named "origin":
bash
Copy code
git remote remove origin
To add a new remote with the updated URL (replace new_repo_url with the URL of your new repository):
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin new_repo_url
Verify that the new remote has been added correctly:
bash
Copy code
git remote -v
This will show you the remotes configured for your Git repository, and you should see the new URL associated with the "origin" remote.

Finally, push your code to the new repository:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin 231023
This will push your local branch to the new remote repository.

After performing these steps, your Git repository will be configured to use the new remote repository URL.
